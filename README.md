# Meyer Distributing Software Tester Technical

Before getting started make sure you have the following installed on your computer

- Node.js (check this by typing `node --v` in a terminal)

- NPM (check this by typing `npm -v` in a terminal)

If you get any kind of error that says neither of those items are installed, follow the instructions on [this page](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

## Basic Instructions

Go through each project ([Test 1](https://github.com/leslieAEwing/meyerDistributingTechnical/tree/main/Test%201), [Test 2](https://github.com/leslieAEwing/meyerDistributingTechnical/tree/main/Test%202), and [Test 3](https://github.com/leslieAEwing/meyerDistributingTechnical/tree/main/Test%203)) and give us a run down of any issues you find. You may find more issues for one project compared to another - that is fine and is to be expected.

Create separate documents for each project with the items you find. To run each project, follow the instructions for each individual project found on each project's README file.

## Project Instructions

Each project was given the same initial instructions on what was to be expected. Here is the general synopsis of what was expected.

    - Image
    - Name of Product
    - Description

    - Button to individual product page (will be linked to an outside website, that is ok)

  - Filter options that should be included (at least, but more could be given)
    - Price
    - Product type
