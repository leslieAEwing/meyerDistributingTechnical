# Test 1 Installation Instructions

1. Open a terminal (Windows powershell or the like) and navigate to the Test 1 folder (make sure to close any of the other projects first before proceeding).
2. Type `npm install` (if you have issues, make sure you installed node and npm - see main [README.md](https://github.com/leslieAEwing/meyerDistributingTechnical) file)
3. Type `npm start`
4. If a browser does not open automatically, open a browser and go to <http://localhost:3000>

Once you have followed these steps and wish to rerun the project, simply follow the steps above but skip step 2.
